# Chapter 3 Textbook Exercises

## Set A

* The table on page 88 summarizes the [string operators](https://youtu.be/jNCoQ2pWr90) nicely.
* Make sure you understand what an index is.
* What is a *prefix*? How is it different from a proper prefix?

## Set B

* You need to use [string methods](https://youtu.be/LFiTPSYsUtU) to solve these. A summary of methods is on page 90.
* For 3.11, you should use some integer math, concatenation, and repetition on a ' ' character to complete the exercise. Use variables on multiple lines to separate things out and make it easy to read. Check the final length of your answer with the `len()` function.
* On 3.13, if you name your function `integerVal()` the output of `integerVal('7')` should be the int `7`. This would be really simple if you use the `int()` function to convert it, but use the `ord()` function instead. Hint: Check the order of the character `'0'` and compare it to the order of `'1'`. For an extra fancy function, add some logic that will test to see if the character passed is indeed a single digit.
* For 3.14 and 3.15, use `ord(a)` to help you shift numbers appropriately. The index is supposed to be zero for the character `'a'`, which is different than its order.

## Set C

* A good hint on 3.19 is to use the modulo operator `%`.
* Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/qOlJwi9mu2Q) on the rail fence cipher, and [this one](https://youtu.be/uaCumJi4Iuw) about its decryption.
* If you want a challenge, make a function that takes the number of rails as a parameter.
* It is really worthwhile to go through the exercise in 3.20. Email or IM your key and encrypted message to a partner and try to decrypt theirs.
* Add these functions to a module and import them. This will make your code cleaner, and you will be able to use them later.

## Set D
